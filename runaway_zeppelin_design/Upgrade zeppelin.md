It is possible to spend [[Resources]] to upgrade the [[Zeppelin]].
* sacrifice cargo space for different new: e.g. improvised landing gear, "factory", where materials are converted into parts
* improve engines
* add protection
* enhance radio room/electrical for tracking storms
* map room/observation for visibility

Kitchen upgradable
Control room upgradable
cabins for 24 passengers (2x4 person cabins, the rest 2 person cabins)
2x toilets
2x showers
rec room
36 bunks
6 to 12 cargo bays

# Radio station
* radio parts
	* resonating crystals
	* strange antenna
	* hollow bones
	* copper wire on a spool
* increases size/accuracy of radio availability
	* detect storms (and especially exit event)
	* communicate with landing crews over extended period
	* signals from events
# Navigation room
* optical parts/navigational tools
	* lenses
	* calipers
	* compass
	* magnetic stones
* increase vision range
* add more information to [[Point of Interest|POI]]s (danger level, needed specialty, reward type (food, parts, etc.))
