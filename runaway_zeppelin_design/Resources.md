There is a number of resources that can be divided into different groups: [[#Water]], [[#Food]], [[#Fuel]], [[#Materials]] and [[#Cargo]].
# Water
There is three types of water: Ballast water, which is enriched with an anti-freezing agent so it can't be used as freshwater, fresh water which can be drank by [[NPC]] or used for [[Event]]s and gray water, which is water used for doing dishes are hygiene and cannot be consumed. Gray water can be reused for doing dishes and hygiene, though.
# Food
There are different subtypes of food: Raw foods, prepared meals, luxury goods and rations. Crew members can live off raw foods and rations without loosing Morale but passengers need prepared meals three times a day. Meals can be prepared by crew members from raw foods. Luxury goods, such as wine or rum, can be used to boost morale by assigning them in [[Policy|Policies]]. The zeppelin has loaded enough rations for all crewmembers for 72h and enough raw food for all passengers for 72h.
# Fuel
There is different types of fuel that can be stored in different tanks: Liquid, solid and gaseous fuel. The default engines on the Zeppelin can use liquid and gaseous fuels. Blaugas, which is the default gaseous fuel the zeppelin has loaded, is lighter than air and provides [[Lift]]. Petrol is the default liquid fuel the zeppelin has loaded and is used to prime the engines. Once they reach operating temperature, they can be switched to Blaugas.
# Materials
Materials are Non-Food items that can be used to repair, upgrade or change the [[Zeppelin]]. Sometimes they can be used to improve chances of a positive outcome on [[Event]]s.
# Cargo
Cargo is everything on board, that doesn't have an immediate value to surviving the perils of the strange lands, like Mailbags, Porcelain, found artifacts etc. When leaving the strange lands, all cargo can be sold for money for [[Meta Progression Updates]].
