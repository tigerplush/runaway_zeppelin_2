In Game time starts on 11th of October 1928 (which is the first transatlantic flight of LZ 127). In Game time starts paused but goes to speed1 when confirming a course. It is possible to switch between pause, speed1, speed2 and speed3 via UI or key presses. Speed1 means time flows at 48 times the usual speed, which means an in-game day will last half an hour. Speed2 is twice the speed of Speed1 and Speed4 is twice the speed of Speed2.
