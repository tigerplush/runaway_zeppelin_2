Before an expedition begins, there is a multi-stage embarkation menu:
First stage shows possible risks and rewards as well as possible requirements (such as rations or specialists).
The second stage allows the player to assign [[NPC]]s and [[Resources]] to the expedition. Then the expedition begins.
A number of reports is then being sent back per radio and shown to the player where he can answer with a command to experience branching storylines per event. Some of the decisions will stay with the player and can later be referenced from other events.
