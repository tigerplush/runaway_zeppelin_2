Points of Interests are points on the [[Map]] where the [[Zeppelin]] can land or moor. Landing or mooring at a POI triggers [[Event]]s. Some POIs can be visited multiple times, while others only once.
Some POIs look the same but trigger subsequent events, like a story told over multiple chapters.
Some POIs only spawn when certain requirements are met, like having been to another POI or having decided a certain way at a previous event.
POIs are modelled in 3D.
